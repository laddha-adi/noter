# Noter


Noter is a minimal Angular app which allows the user to create and remove notes. [Manan Agarwal's Project](https://github.com/MananAgarwal/Noter) motivated me to create this in angular. The app has been integrated Firebase's RealTime Database and uses Firebase Hosting to host it [here](https://noter-e2fb5.firebaseapp.com/). 

Work in Progress: Adding functionality to edit Notes

ToDo:   Ability to choose color of the notes.
        Making the notes responsive.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
